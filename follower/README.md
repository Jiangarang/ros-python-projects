This code is a ROS node that uses a camera to follow a yellow line. 
The code subscribes to the video feed from the camera, and applies 
a filter to extract only the yellow pixels. It then finds the centroid 
(i.e., the center of mass) of the yellow pixels, and uses that 
information to drive a robot in such a way as to keep the centroid 
centered in the camera's field of view.

The robot's linear velocity is set to 0.2 m/s, and its angular 
velocity is controlled based on the error between the centroid 
location and the center of the image. The error is converted into 
an angular velocity command using a function, and the 
resulting command is published to a topic that controls the robot's 
motion.
