HOW TO RUN: please use $roslaunch wall_follower wall_follower.launch

This will launch all three of the nodes correctly if they are marked as executable.

PLEASE INCLUDE THE REST OF THE README HERE

PLEASE READ: roslaunch did not work for me, wall_follower was not recognized as a package, even after I performed catkin_create_pkg and made sure it was under
the correct path

To startup gazebo:
in one cmd tab: [:]~$ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage_1.launch

To begin nodes:
in another tab: [:]~$ rosrun prrexamples scan_values_handler.py
in another tab: [:]~$ rosrun prrexamples driver.py
